# Note:
There is no generate_graph.py function file in the main branch; it can only be found in the branch named Megan. That is due to both iterations of the code I have for it
crashing the program, so we decided it was best to just leave it in my branch and not push it to the main one. Thank you for understanding, whoever's grading this.
